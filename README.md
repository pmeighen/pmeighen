Hi there

I am currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania LPS cooding bootcamp.    
The list of languages we will cover are as follows; C#, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, Jave Script, Python, Raptor, SQL, Mongo, and several others.
I expect to graduate on June 15th.  I will be posting my work here as the course progresses.
