Hi there

I am surrently a student at Academy Pittsburgh learning the following languages.  
The list of languages we have covered, or will cover, inclde...
C#, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, Jave Script, Python, Raptor, SQL, Mongo, and several others.
I expect to graduate on or about mid-April but that date is currently a floating target but is a good estimate of when the program will wrap up.
